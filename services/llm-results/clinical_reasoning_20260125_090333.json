  "clinical_summary": "Across two laboratory assessments (2025-03-07 and 2025-07-13), the complete blood count remained within normal limits with normal differential and platelet counts, and peripheral smear was reported as normal. Liver enzymes (ALT 10 U/L, AST 12 U/L) were normal, while total bilirubin was mildly elevated to 1.4 mg/dL on the later date with a direct fraction of 0.6 mg/dL. C‑reactive protein was 1.8 mg/dL and procalcitonin 0.13 ng/mL, both within low‑risk ranges. No other abnormalities were documented.",
